# 👋 Hi, I'm Mounika

🎓 I’m a 2nd-year B.Tech ECE student passionate about **VLSI design**, especially the **analog layout** and **digital RTL design** side using open-source tools.

🔬 Currently exploring the **Skywater 130nm PDK** through hands-on projects involving layout design and simulation, alongside digital design fundamentals learned in the HCL Tech course.

💻 Interested in RTL to GDSII, STA, DRC/LVS, TCL Scripting
