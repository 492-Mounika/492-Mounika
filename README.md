## 🛠️ Skills

### 💻 RTL Design & Digital Logic

- Learning to design **combinational and sequential logic** blocks in Verilog (MUX, ALU, FSMs, counters)
- Learning to develop **testbenches** and simulate designs using `EDA Playground`, `ModelSim`, and `GTKWave`
- Understanding of **ASIC frontend flow**: RTL → Simulation → Synthesis

### 🧪 Verification & Debugging

- Learning `SystemVerilog` for writing structured testbenches  
- Gaining experience in **functional simulation**, **waveform analysis**, and **bug tracing**

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- `Verilog`, `SystemVerilog`  
- `EDA Playground`, `ModelSim`, `GTKWave`  
- `Linux`, `Git`, basic scripting in `Python`
